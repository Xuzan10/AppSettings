# AppSettings
* Show list of application installed in phone and opening its app settings page.
* Kotlin language use with simple databinding.
* Searchable recyclerview implemented.

This is simple app just to help me clear data more efficiently. In some emulator, we can't go to app setting page directly
by holding application icon and should go to settings->manage_apps->app->clear data, so just to help me clear data in my 
project "LabelStep", it was useful. It is just too simple though and I think it is redundant app for other. :D
